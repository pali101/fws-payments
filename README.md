# FWS Payments Contract

The FWS Payments contract enables ERC20 token payment flows through "rails" - automated payment channels between clients and recipients. The contract supports continuous payments, one-time transfers, and payment arbitration.

## Key Concepts

- **Account**: Represents a user's token balance and locked funds
- **Rail**: A payment channel between a client and recipient with configurable terms
- **Arbiter**: An optional contract that can mediate payment disputes
- **Operator**: An authorized third party who can manage rails on behalf of clients

### Account

Tracks the funds, lockup, obligations, etc. associated with a single “owner” (where the owner is a smart contract or a wallet). Accounts can be both *clients* and *SPs* but we’ll often talk about them as if they were separate types.

- **Client —** An account that *pays* an SP (also referred to as the *payer*)
- **SP** — An account managed by a service provider to receive payment from a client (also referred to as the *payee*).

### Rail

A rail along which payments flow from a client to an SP. Rails track lockup, maximum payment rates, and obligations between a client and an SP. Client-SP pairs can have multiple payment rails between them but they can also reuse the same rail across multiple deals. Importantly, rails:
    - Specify the maximum rate at which the client will pay the SP, the actual amount paid for any given period is subject to arbitration by the **arbiter** described below.
    - Specify the period in advanced the client is required to lock funds (the **lockup period**). There’s no way to force clients to lock funds in advanced, but we can prevent them from *withdrawing* them and make it easy for SPs to tell if their clients haven’t met their lockup minimums, giving them time to settle their accounts.

### **Arbiter**

An arbiter is an (optional) smart contract that can arbitrate payments associated with a single rail. For example, a payment rail used for PDP will specify the PDP service as its arbiter An arbiter can:

- Prevent settlement of a payment rail entirely.
- Refuse to settle a payment rail past some epoch.
- Reduce the amount paid out by a rail for a period of time (e.g., to account for actual services rendered, penalties, etc.).

### Operator

An operator is a smart contract (likely the service contract) that manages rails on behalf of clients & SPs, with approval from the client (the client approves the operator to spend its funds at a specific rate). The operator smart contract must be trusted by both the client and the SP as it can arbitrarily alter payments (within the allowance specified by the client). It:

- Creates rails from clients to service providers.
- Changes payment rates, lockups, etc. of payment rails created by this operator.
    - The sum of payment rates across all rails operated by this contract for a specific client must be at most the maximum per-operator spend rate specified by the client.
    - The sum of the lockup across all rails operated by this contract for a specific client must be at most the maximum per-operator lockup specified by the client.
- Specify/change the payment rail arbiter of payment rails created by this operator.

### Arbitration

The contract supports optional payment arbitration through the `IArbiter` interface. When a rail has an arbiter:

1. During settlement, the arbiter contract is called
2. The arbiter can adjust payment amounts or partially settle epochs
3. This provides dispute resolution capabilities for complex payment arrangements

## Worked Example

This worked example demonstrates how users interact with the FWS Payments contract through a typical service deal lifecycle.

### 1. Initial Funding

A client first deposits tokens to fund their account in the payments contract:

```solidity
// 1. Client approves the Payments contract to spend tokens
IERC20(tokenAddress).approve(paymentsContractAddress, 100 * 10**18); // 100 tokens

// A client or anyone else can deposit to the client's account
Payments(paymentsContractAddress).deposit(
    tokenAddress,   // ERC20 token address
    clientAddress,  // Recipient's address (the client)
    100 * 10**18    // Amount to deposit (100 tokens)
);
```

After this operation, the client's `Account.funds` is credited with 100 tokens, enabling them to use services within the FWS ecosystem.

This operation _may_ be deferred until the funds are actually required, funding is always "on-demand".

### 2. Operator Approval

Before using a service, the client must approve the service's contract as an operator:

```solidity
// Client approves a service contract as an operator
Payments(paymentsContractAddress).setOperatorApproval(
    tokenAddress,           // ERC20 token address
    serviceContractAddress, // Operator address (service contract)
    true,                   // Approval status
    5 * 10**18,             // Maximum rate (tokens per epoch) the operator can allocate
    20 * 10**18             // Maximum lockup the operator can set
);
```

This approval has two key components:

- The `rateAllowance` (5 tokens/epoch) limits the total continuous payment rate across all rails created by this operator
- The `lockupAllowance` (20 tokens) limits the total fixed amount the operator can lock up for one-time payments or escrow

### 3. Deal Proposal (Rail Creation)

When a client proposes a deal with a service provider, the service contract (acting as an operator) creates a payment rail:

```solidity
// Service contract creates a rail
uint256 railId = Payments(paymentsContractAddress).createRail(
    tokenAddress,     // Token used for payments
    clientAddress,    // Payer (client)
    serviceProvider,  // Payee (service provider)
    arbiterAddress    // Optional arbiter (can be address(0) for no arbitration)
);

// Set up initial lockup for onboarding costs - for example, 10 tokens as fixed lockup
Payments(paymentsContractAddress).modifyRailLockup(
    railId,         // Rail ID
    100,            // Lockup period (100 epochs)
    10 * 10**18     // Fixed lockup amount (10 tokens for onboarding)
);
```

At this point:

- A rail is established between the client and service provider
- The rail has a `fixedLockup` of 10 tokens and a `lockupPeriod` of 100 epochs
- The payment `rate` is still 0 (service hasn't started yet)
- The client's account lockup threshold is increased by 10 tokens

### 4. Deal Acceptance and Service Start

When the service provider accepts the deal:

```solidity
// Service contract (operator) increases the payment rate and makes a one-time payment
Payments(paymentsContractAddress).modifyRailPayment(
    railId,           // Rail ID
    2 * 10**18,       // New payment rate (2 tokens per epoch)
    3 * 10**18        // One-time onboarding payment (3 tokens)
);
```

This operation:

- Makes an immediate one-time payment of 3 tokens to the service provider, deducted from the rail's fixed lockup
- Updates the client's `lockupCurrent` to include rate × `lockupPeriod`
- The client's account now locks `2 × 100 + (10-3) = 207` tokens including the remaining fixed lockup, locking an additional 2 tokens every epoch

### 5. Periodic Settlement

Payment settlement can be triggered by any rail participant:

```solidity
// Settlement call - can be made by client, service provider, or operator
(uint256 amount, uint256 settledEpoch, string memory note) = Payments(paymentsContractAddress).settleRail(
    railId,        // Rail ID
    block.number   // Settle up to current epoch
);
```

This settlement:

- Calculates amount owed based on rail's rate and time elapsed
- Transfers tokens from client's account to service provider's account
- If an arbiter is specified, it may modify the payment amount or limit settlement epochs
- Records the epoch up to which the rail has been settled

A rail may only be settled if either (a) the client's account is fully funded or (b) the rail is terminated (in which case the rail may be settled up to the rail's "end epoch").

### 6. Deal Modification

If service terms change during the deal:

```solidity
// Operator modifies payment parameters
Payments(paymentsContractAddress).modifyRailPayment(
    railId,           // Rail ID
    4 * 10**18,       // Increased rate (4 tokens per epoch)
    0                 // No one-time payment
);

// If lockup terms need changing
Payments(paymentsContractAddress).modifyRailLockup(
    railId,         // Rail ID
    150,            // Extended lockup period (150 epochs)
    15 * 10**18     // Increased fixed lockup (15 tokens)
);
```

### 7. Deal Cancellation

When a user cancels a deal, the service contract will modify the rail's payment to take that into account. In this case, the service contract sets the rail's payment rate to zero and pays a fixed termination fee out of the rail's "fixed" lockup.

```solidity
// Service contract reduces payment rate and possibly issues a termination payment
Payments(paymentsContractAddress).modifyRailPayment(
    railId,        // Rail ID
    0,             // Zero out payment rate
    5 * 10**18     // Termination fee (5 tokens)
);
```

### 9. Final Settlement and Withdrawal

After a terminated rail reaches its `endEpoch`, it can be fully settled to unlock all remaining funds.

```solidity
// Final settlement
(uint256 amount, uint256 settledEpoch, string memory note) = Payments(paymentsContractAddress).settleRail(
    railId,        // Rail ID
    rails[railId].endEpoch // Settle up to end epoch
);

// Client withdraws remaining funds
Payments(paymentsContractAddress).withdraw(
    tokenAddress,    // Token address
    remainingAmount  // Amount to withdraw
);
```

## Emergency Scenarios

If some component in the system (operator, arbiter, client, SP) misbehaves, all parties have escape hatches that allow them to walk away with predictable losses.

### Reducing Operator Allowance

At any time, the client can reduce the operator's allowance (e.g., to zero) and/or change whether or not the operator is allowed to create new rails. Such modifications won't affect existing rails, although the operator will not be able to increase the payment rates on any rails they manage until they're back under their limits.

### Rail Termination (by client)

If something goes wrong (e.g., the operator is buggy and is refusing to terminate deals, stop payment, etc.), the client may terminate the to prevent future payment beyond the rail's lockup period. The client must ensure that their account is fully funded before they can terminate any rails.

```solidity
// Client terminates the rail
Payments(paymentsContractAddress).terminateRail(railId);
```

Termination:

- Forcibly reduces the rail's payment rate to zero `lockupPeriod` epochs into the future.
- Immediately stops locking new funds to the rail.
- Causes any fixed funds locked to the rail to automatically unlock after the `lockupPeriod` elapses.

### Rail Termination (by operator)

At any time, even if the client's account isn't fully funded, the operator can terminate a rail. This will allow the recipient to settle any funds available in the rail to receive partial payment.

### Rail Settlement Without Arbitration

If an arbiter contract is malfunctioning, the _client_ may forcibly settle the rail the rail "in full" (skipping arbitration) to prevent the funds from getting stuck in the rail pending final arbitration. This can only be done after the rail has been terminated (either by the client or by the operator), and should be used as a last resort.

```solidity
// Emergency settlement for terminated rails with stuck arbitration
(uint256 amount, uint256 settledEpoch, string memory note) = Payments(paymentsContractAddress).settleTerminatedRailWithoutArbitration(railId);
```
